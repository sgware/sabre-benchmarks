 little or no lookahead when making their decisions.
 Reactive storytelling systems scale well but produce emergent stories that
 may be hard to control.
 Planning systems are expensive but can guarantee constraints on a story's
 content and structure.

 was perhaps the first to suggest that AI planning algorithms would be suitable
 for interactive storytelling in computer systems.
 A planning algorithm is a symbolic, logical system that takes as input
 (1) a description of the initial state, (2) a goal, and (3) a set of possible
 actions which have preconditions that must hold before they occur and effects
 which modify the world state.
 A planning algorithm, or 
\emph on
planner
\emph default
, searches for a plan—a sequence of actions executable in the initial state
 that achieves the goal

.
 Young observed that planners provide a formal, generative model of action
 and can reason about narratively important properties like causality.

\begin_layout Subsection
Planners for Narrative vs.
 Narrative Planners
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To oversimplify the research landscape, there are two broad approaches to
 planning stories.
 The first uses off-the-shelf planners for storytelling purposes.
 Their advantage is that advances in planning research can immediately be
 leveraged for storytelling.
 Their disadvantage is that all narrative reasoning must be encoded into
 the preconditions and effects of actions, or into other features provided
 by a planner that was not designed for storytelling.
 This approach is often used by Marc Cavazza and his academic descendants

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second approach modifies planning algorithms to reason directly about
 narrative phenomena.
 In this approach, the preconditions and effects of actions are limited
 to the most basic constraints; other features of the planner decide when
 they should occur based on explicit narrative reasoning.
 Their advantage is a richer set of storytelling features in the algorithm;
 their disadvantage is that it becomes difficult to integrate advances in
 planning research into these systems.
 This approach is often used by R.

 arose from the second school of thought.
 Though none of its individual features is unique, it is the first algorithm
 with this particular set of features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Intentionality:
\emph default
 A character can only take an action if they believe it will further their
 goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Conflict:
\emph default
 Characters can thwart one another's plans, and stories can contain failed
 or partially-executed character plans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Arbitrary Theory of Mind:
\emph default
 It reasons about what is actually true, what character 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 believes, what 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 believes character 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 believes, what 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 believes 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 believes 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 believes, and so on, arbitrarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
No Uncertainty:
\emph default
 Beliefs can be wrong, but characters always commit to their beliefs.
 They can believe 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\neg p$
\end_inset

 is the case, but they cannot believe 
\begin_inset Formula $p\vee q$
\end_inset

.
 This limitation increases the size of the problems Sabre can solve at the
 cost of a feature some might find desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This set of features was chosen based on the needs of the interactive narratives
 we are developing at the Narrative Intelligence Lab at the University of
 Kentucky.
 We make no claim that they are the most desirable in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sabre begins at the initial state of a storytelling problem and performs
 a forward heuristic search through the space of states until it finds a
 state where the author's goal for the story is achieved.
 Every action taken on the way to that goal must be 
\emph on
explained
\emph default
 for each of the characters
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Sabre uses the term 
\emph on
character
\emph default
, instead of 
\emph on
agent
\emph default
, because they are not independent decision-makers.
 The planner is the only agent.
 It acts like a puppetmaster, omniscient but attempting to make each character
 seem like it has its own goals and limited, possibly wrong beliefs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 who takes the action (called the 
\emph on
consenting characters
\emph default
).
 An action is 
\emph on
explained for a character
\emph default
 when that character can imagine a plan that starts with the action and
 which, according to that character's beliefs, will lead to a better state
 for that character and contains only explained actions.

About this Collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sabre provides several search methods and heuristics.
 To test them, we have written several problems.
 We also want to compare Sabre's performance on problems written by others,
 so we have collected what problems we can from the narrative planning literatur
e.
 Many of these problems were created for other planning systems, so we have
 had to translate them into Sabre's syntax, a process which has certainly
 introduced some bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to partially mitigate that bias, the next section details
 the process we followed when translating problems for testing in Sabre.
 The third section gives details about each problem and explains their origins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is our hope that this collection of problems will serve as a repository
 of benchmark problems for those interested in narrative planning.
 However, we also want to offer a word of caution learned from the AI planning
 community.
 Performance on this suite of problems should not be considered an authoritative
 measure of whether a planner is state-of-the-art.
 A planner should not be judged uninteresting because it fails to perform
 well on these tests.
 In other words, we want these benchmarks to encourage comparison across
 planners without limiting the richness of narrative planning research.

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some of the problems in this collection were initially created for
 Sabre, many were originally made for other systems with different features
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Most problems we translated were originally written in PDDL, the Planning
 Domain Definition Language 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "malik1998pddl"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, or something similar to it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We want to show that Sabre can generalize enough to solve problems established
 by other systems, but we recognize that translating these problems has
 changed them.
 This section explains the guidelines we followed when translating problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spirit Over Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our translations have attempted to maintain the spirit of a problem as we
 understood it rather than its exact formal structure.
 The goal was to write the problem as if the original author had designed
 it for Sabre from the beginning.
 For example, many early planning systems use only Boolean predicates, whereas
 Sabre supports multi-valued fluents.
 We could have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 translated these problems by using only Boolean fluents in Sabre, but this
 makes the problem artificially harder.
 Consider representing a character's location when there are 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $c=\{c_{1},c_{2},...\}$
\end_inset


\emph default
 characters and 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $p=\{p_{1},p_{2},...\}$
\end_inset


\emph default
 places.
 A Boolean fluent like 
\begin_inset Formula $location(c_{1},p_{1})$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

character 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is at place 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and we need 
\begin_inset Formula $|c|\cdot|p|$
\end_inset

 of these fluents, exactly one of which is true in any state.
 Sabre can use a single fluent 
\begin_inset Formula $location(c)$
\end_inset

 which can have any place as its value.
 When possible, we used multi-valued fluents like this, even though it results
 in a less exact translation of the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fixing Bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some problems had mistakes which we have fixed.
 In some cases, we contacted the original authors (or we were the original
 authors), so we are confident in these changes.
 Some were judgment calls based on our understanding of the spirit of the
 problem.
 For example, one of the key events in the 
\emph on
Hospital
\emph default
 problem is a stressed doctor misdiagnosing a patient.
 The effects of the 
\family typewriter
mistake-assess
\family default
 action never appear as preconditions of any other action or in the problem
 goal; we believe this was a mistake in the original problem, and we have
 modified it to allow a mistaken diagnosis to lead to a patient's death.
 Similar bugs have been fixed in other problems and are noted in the details
 for that problem in this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goals as Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most planners use propositions to define the goals of a planning problem.
 Sabre uses utility functions—numeric expressions to be maximized.
 Sabre defines an author utility, which the solution plan itself should
 maximize, and one character utility function per character, which those
 characters each try to maximize.
 Some narrative planners do not represent character goals at all.
 Some do, but allow characters to adopt and drop their goals during a plan.
 Sabre's utility functions cannot be changed during a plan, though their
 values can be conditional.
 For all of these reasons, translating the goals of problems into Sabre
 utility functions required some significant interpretation.
 Consider the 
\emph on
Western
\emph default
 problem, where a character can be bitten by a snake, causing everyone who
 loves that character to adopt the goal of healing the snakebite.
 When it is healed, the goal is dropped.
 We represent this in Sabre using numeric fluents like 
\begin_inset Formula $relationship(c_{1},c_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 loves 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 is healthy, the value of this fluent is 1.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 does not love 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

, or if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 is sick, the value is 0.
 Each character's relationships contribute to their utility function.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 loves 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 is bitten by a snake, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

's utility decreases by 1, and any plan which restores 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

's health raises 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

's utility by 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
One Problem, Few Versions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The benchmark problems used in the AI planning community typically distinguish
 between a 
\emph on
domain
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
problem
\emph default
.
 A domain defines the actions while a problem defines a set of objects,
 an initial state, and a goal.
 There are typically many problems per domain.
 There seems to be less of a need for this distinction in storytelling systems.
 Many storytelling domains have only one associated problem, or a few very
 similar problems.
 There is less variation in their initial states and goals.
 Sabre defines everything—actions, objects, initial state, and goals—in
 the same unit, called a problem.
 This does not mean a Sabre problem can tell only a single story.
 Complex utility functions and disjunctive goals can give rise to many stories.
 Consider the 
\emph on
Save Gramma
\emph default
 problem, where Tom represents the player character in an interactive narrative
 game.
 The author's utility is 0 in the initial state, 1 when Tom is dead, and
 2 when Tom achieves his goal of returning home with medicine for his grandmothe
r.
 There are many ways for Tom to die and for Tom to complete his goal, so
 a wide variety of stories can still be told when solving this problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can represent several versions of a Sabre problem (what other planning
 researchers might call many problems in the same domain) by setting a higher
 goal for the author utility.
 In 
\emph on
Save Gramma
\emph default
, a goal of reaching author utility 1 means any plan that ends in either
 Tom's death or the successful completion of Tom's quest can be accepted
 as a solution.
 This corresponds to the benchmark problem 
\family typewriter
gramma_any
\family default
.
 By setting a goal of author utility 2, only solutions where Tom completes
 his quest are accepted.
 This corresponds to the benchmark problem 
\family typewriter
gramma_win
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a problem's goal has multiple parts, we typically made each of these
 parts contribute independently to the author's utility.
 This allows the same Sabre problem to be used in many benchmark tasks simply
 by settings a higher goal for the author's utility.
 Consider 
\emph on
Aladdin
\emph default
.
 The original problem has a goal with two parts: Jasmine is married to Jafar
 and the Genie is dead.
 In our version of the problem, the author gains 1 point of utility for
 each of these.
 The benchmark problem 
\family typewriter
aladdin_any
\family default
 can be solved by any story that marries Jasmine to Jafar or kills the genie,
 whereas both goals must be achieved in 
\family typewriter
aladdin_both
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some problems, like 
\emph on
Hospital
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Basketball
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Lovers
\emph default
, were designed as domains with multiple problems in mind.
 In those cases, we have chosen a single problem to implement, usually the
 smallest and simplest.
 This reduces the richness and variety of the original problems, but our
 objective with this suite of benchmarks is to test many types of stories
 rather than many stories of the same type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Belief
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sabre tracks what is actually true, what each agent believes, what they
 believe others believe, and so on arbitrarily.
 Sabre provides three ways that beliefs are updated.
 First, each action has an 
\emph on
observation function
\emph default
 which defines when a character notices an action occur.
 When a character observes an action, they update their beliefs (and their
 beliefs about the beliefs of others who observed it, etc.).
 Sabre also provides 
\emph on
triggers
\emph default
, which are like actions except they must occur when they can.
 Triggers are frequently used for belief updates.
 For example, one commonly used trigger can be read as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When character 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 is at the same location as character 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 believes 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 is somewhere else, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 now realizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 is at their location.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Finally, Sabre actions can update character beliefs directly.
 The 
\family typewriter
report
\family default
 action in 
\emph on
Save Gramma
\emph default
, where one character tells the guard they have seen the bandit, and the
 
\family typewriter
tell
\family default
 action in 
\emph on
Lovers
\emph default
, where one character tells another what item they want, are two actions
 with examples of direct belief updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When translating problems that did not originally model beliefs, we tried
 to use semantics informed by the stories being modeled.
 Most problems have some concept of a location, so generally characters
 observe any action that happens at their location.
 Most problems include triggers that allow characters to observe the people,
 places, and things, at their location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some problems originally designed for planners that do no model belief occasiona
lly used predicates that clearly represented beliefs.
 For example, the 
\family typewriter
knows-location
\family default
 predicate in the original version of 
\emph on
Raiders of the Lost Ask
\emph default
 has been removed and replaced with Sabre's model of belief about a location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any wrong beliefs that characters have in the initial state must be specified;
 otherwise Sabre assumes their beliefs reflect the real world.
 For most problems that did not originally model belief we assumed no wrong
 beliefs, unless they were obvious from the semantics, such as the 
\family typewriter
knows-location
\family default
 predicate above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intentionality is the tendency of intelligent agents to act in service of
 their own goals, or in Sabre's case, to raise their own utilities.
 Each Sabre action has a list of characters, called the 
\emph on
consenting characters
\emph default
, who must have a reason to take the action.
 A Sabre plan can only contain an action if it is explained for all its
 consenting characters.
 An action is explained for a character if that action is the first in a
 sequence of actions which that character believes they can take, will result
 in a higher utility for them, and is composed only of actions which that
 character believes are also explained for all their consenting characters.
 Note that intention is linked to belief—characters can take actions they
 think will help, but wrong beliefs may cause their actions to go awry.
 In 
\emph on
Raiders of the Lost Ark
\emph default
, the Nazis believe opening the Ark of the Covenant will grant them immortality,
 so they open it; in reality, it kills them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An action with no consenting characters is called an author-only action
 and represents a 
\emph on
deux ex machina
\emph default
—an action that the author can choose for the sole reason that it advances
 the plot.
 Characters cannot expect them to happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When translating problems that did not originally model intention, we used
 the semantics of the verbs the actions modeled.
 Typically any characters mentioned in an action were made consenting characters
, with some obvious exceptions.
 For example, in 
\emph on
Basketball
\emph default
, the thief is the only consenting character for 
\family typewriter
steal
\family default
; clearly this action is reasonable even when the victim does not want it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Guided by Exemplar Stories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problems generally had known solutions provided by the original author.
 While translating problems, we ensured these example solutions, or something
 very similar in spirit, could be produced by the Sabre version of the problem.
 These exemplar solutions are listed in the section for each problem, but
 this does not imply that they are the only solutions that exist, or even
 the best solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Occasionally, ensuring these solutions were possible required us to violate
 the guidelines.
 For example, in 
\emph on
Western
\emph default
 we assume that characters only observe actions that occur at their location.
 This means the town sheriff (who starts at the saloon) will not notice
 Hank's robbery of the general store.
 To ensure the exemplar solution was still possible, we modified the 
\family typewriter
take
\family default
 action so the sheriff always observes it no matter his location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Occasionally it was impossible to ensure exemplar solutions were possible
 due to Sabre's minimality constraint.
 A plan is minimal if no actions can be left out without lowering the utility
 it achieves or causing other actions to become unexplained.
 Sabre requires plans for characters and the author to be minimal
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A minimal plan does not need to be the shortest possible plan, but it cannot
 contain any steps that could be left out.
 In other words, if some subsequence of a plan is also explained and achieves
 the same utility, that subsequence is the solution, not the longer plan.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but some exemplar stories were not minimal.
 The original 
\emph on
Space
\emph default
 story is about a misunderstanding between a starship captain and an alien.
 They battle to a stalemate and flee when a volcano starts to erupt.
 The battle sequence can be left out without changing the outcome, so even
 though that sequence of actions exists for Sabre and is explained, it is
 not considered a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as we designed problems to produce ideal solutions, we sometimes modified
 them to avoid producing problematic ones, even if they were valid solutions
 to the original problem.
 In the original 
\emph on
Western
\emph default
, after being bitten by a snake, Timmy could tie up his father, drag him
 to the jailhouse, then walk to the general store to steal the antivenom
 himself.
 His path via the jailhouse, and his dragging a prisoner around with him,
 are an unnecessarily long yet still valid and minimal path to the general
 store.
 It also happens to be a convenient way to achieve the author's goal.
 We have modified the problem to rule out this strange solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recommended Search Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three important limits that can be imposed on Sabre's search.
 The 
\emph on
author temporal limit
\emph default
 is the maximum number of actions in the author's plan—that is, the actual
 actions that will be executed to raise the author's utility.
 The 
\emph on
character temporal limit
\emph default
 is the maximum number of actions in a plan a character imagines when justifying
 an action.
 Consider this solution to the 
\emph on
Save Gramma
\emph default
 problem:

Only the first action in Tom's plan actually happens in the story before
 he is interrupted by the bandit.
 Still, he has to have a reason to walk to the crossroads before he can
 act, and the planner cannot find this reason unless the character temporal
 limit is set to 5 or higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third limit is the 
\emph on
epistemic limit
\emph default
, which constrains how deeply Sabre will search into a character's theory
 of mind.
 It is important to note that Sabre always has an infinitely deep theory
 of mind, and beliefs are always modeled the same way regardless of this
 limit.
 The epistemic limit only affects which states will be explored by the search.
 In other words, setting this limit to 0 does not remove or alter Sabre's
 theory of mind; it only limits which solutions can be found.
 It is also important to note that Sabre can still 
\emph on
reason
\emph default
 deeper than this limit without necessarily 
\emph on
searching
\emph default
 deeper than this limit.
 Tom's plan to buy the medicine from the merchant requires reasoning 2 layers
 deep, because Tom has to anticipate that the merchant will sell him the
 medicine.
 Sabre has to reason about what Tom believes the merchant believes (2 layers).
 However, the solution can still be found with an epistemic limit of 1.
 The state that represents the merchant's beliefs after buying the medicine
 is generated even though it is never visited.
 Not visited means Sabre never considers building longer plans starting
 in that state, but because the merchant's utility is instantly improved
 in that state, Sabre does not need a longer plan to recognize it as good
 for the merchant.
 An epistemic limit of 1 is sufficient to find this explanation, even though
 it reasons about a belief at layer 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each problem, we list recommended settings for the author temporal limit,
 character temporal limit, and epistemic limit.
 These limits allow all of the exemplar solutions described for that problem.
 For some problems, we recommend a higher epistemic limit than what is strictly
 required to produced the example solutions because those problems allow
 interesting behavior that can only happen at higher epistemic limits.
 For example, in Save Gramma, characters will never report the bandit's
 location to the guard unless they can imagine the guard chasing after the
 bandit, so while the exemplar solutions can be found with an epistemic
 limit of 1, we recommend 2 for that problem to allow actions like 
\family typewriter
report
\family default
 to be explored.

The problem is small and describes how a villain gains control over the
 president using a bribe.
 It has three characters: the villain, the president, and a hero who the
 villain can manipulate into robbing a bank to obtain the money needed for
 the bribe.
 The two solutions to this problem were originally meant to highlight a
 feature of Riedl's Fabulist system
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that allowed characters to act contrary to their personalities if given
 sufficient motivation.
 In this problem, the usually lawful hero can rob a bank if they are first
 coerced by the villain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Riedl's planner models intention but not belief.
 It also has a feature that allows one character to delegate its goals to
 another, which was used in the 
\family typewriter
coerce
\family default
 action.
 There is no easy way to translate this notion of goal delegation into Sabre's
 utility functions.
 To maintain the minimality and simplicity of the original problem, we have
 modified the 
\family typewriter
coerce
\family default
 action to cause the coerced character to want an item to be at a specific
 location.
 In the example below, 
\family typewriter
coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)
\family default
 makes the hero want the villain to have the money.

The problem illustrates how actions can be reused for multiple goals.
 The protagonist, Bubba, owns a gun and some ammunition.
 He can become greedy and use his gun to rob a bank.
 He can also become hungry and use his gun to hunt a deer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Riedl's planner models intention but not belief.
 In the original problem, author-only actions caused Bubba to adopt the
 goal of having money or not being hungry.
 This allowed the planner to choose either or both goals for the story.
 We have preserved that structure by changing the 
\family typewriter
decide_to_get_money
\family default
 action to increase Bubba's greed (allowing him to raise his utility by
 stealing money) and the 
\family typewriter
decide_to_eat
\family default
 action to make Bubba hungry (lowering his utility, and allowing him to
 raise it again by eating).
 The author gains 1 point of utility when Bubba gets money and 1 point when
 the deer is eaten.

The problem requires a secret agent to enter the compound of an evil mastermind
 and assassinate him.
 To enter, he must be unarmed, but to assassinate the mastermind he needs
 a gun, which he can find in the compound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Riedl's planner models intention but not belief.
 It also has a feature that allows the planner to decide some parts of the
 initial state that the author intentionally left unspecified.
 In this example, the location of the gun was unspecified, and the planner
 could place it at any location.
 We have preserved this feature by adding the 
\family typewriter
find
\family default
 action, which allows the agent to find an item at their current location
 as long as the item's location has not yet been set.
 Note the 
\family typewriter
find
\family default
 action has the secret agent as a consenting character.
 It cannot be an author-only action; if so the agent would not believe it
 is possible to find a gun after entering the compound and would never act.

Aladdin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the fourth and largest of four problems detailed in the appendix
 of Riedl's dissertation.
 It was also detailed in a journal article about Riedl's IPOCL planner,
 so we suggest using that citation when referring to this problem.

\noindent
The problem is an alternative version of the tale of 
\emph on
Aladdin
\emph default
, which was added to a later edition of 
\emph on
One Thousand and One Nights
\emph default
 and later adapted into a 1992 Disney film.
 Many elements have been changed.
 Jafar is king, not adviser to the king.
 A dragon has been added.
 The end of the story has been changed.
 These modifications were likely due to the fact that Riedl's planner did
 not support conflict, the ability for an agent to partially execute a plan
 which then fails.
 Support for conflict was added in a later algorithm by Ware et al.

\begin_layout Standard
Riedl's and Young's planner models intention but not belief.
 It also has a feature that allows one character to delegate its goals to
 another, which was used in the original 
\family typewriter
order
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
command
\family default
 actions.
 There is no easy way to translate this notion of goal delegation into Sabre's
 utility functions.
 To maintain their spirit, we have replaced them with the 
\family typewriter
command_kill
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
command_love
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
command_bring
\family default
 actions, which model a requester assigning a task to a worker.
 The tasks require the worker to kill a character, bring an item, or cause
 another character to love the requester respectively.
 Characters gain utility by completing tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original problem goal has two parts: Jasmine should be married to Jafar
 and the genie should be dead.
 The author gains 1 point of utility for each, allowing two versions of
 this problem.

\noindent
The version on her website is simpler than the one described in the paper.
 Actions like 
\family typewriter
spread-malicious-gossip
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
show-appreciation-treatment-advice
\family default
 are missing, with this simpler version focusing on a stressed doctor who
 can make a mistake when treating too many patients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Porteous et al.
 use an off-the-shelf planner which does not reason about intention or belief.
 We have added these concepts based on our understanding of medical dramas.
 Because Sabre models belief, we were able to combine the 
\family typewriter
assess
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
mistake-asses
\family default
 action into a single action.
 The doctor can diagnose a patient with the wrong illness if they are overworked.
 The effects of our 
\family typewriter
assess
\family default
 action are that the doctor and patient believe the patient has a certain
 illness, but these beliefs can be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have also fixed what we suppose to be two bugs.
 In the original, the effects of the 
\family typewriter
mistake-assess
\family default
 action were never used in the preconditions of other actions or in the
 goal.
 Also, the preconditions of the 
\family typewriter
die
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
recover
\family default
 action were not constrained by the patient's diagnosis.
 This meant patients who got the correct treatment could still die and those
 who got the wrong treatment could still recover.
 This may have been intended, but we modified the problem so that patients
 who get the correct treatment always recover and those who get the wrong
 treatment always die.
 In doing this, we removed the 
\family typewriter
die
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
recover
\family default
 actions and added a conditional effect to 
\family typewriter
treat
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original problem was specified as a PDDL domain with 10 associated problems.
 We used the first problem in our translation, which has a single doctor
 and 3 patients.
 Because they are not needed in that problem, we removed the 
\family typewriter
move
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
get-work-help
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
lose-consciousness
\family default
 actions from our version.
 Each of the original 10 problems had different goals.
 In our version, the author gains 1 point of utility if some patient has
 been healed and 1 point if some patient has died.

It describes a crime drama where characters can commit theft and murder
 while investigators search for clues and arrest criminals.
 Characters get angry when their items are stolen but can let off steam
 by playing basketball.
 The version of the problem we translated was provided by Julie Porteous
 on her website.

The version on her website differs slightly from the one described in the
 paper.
 The 
\family typewriter
earthquake
\family default
 action is missing, and some additional concepts are present, like vehicles.
 This PDDL domain was provided with 10 different problems whose objects
 and initial states are similar but whose goals specify a variety of outcomes,
 like what crimes should be committed, who should be angry, who should be
 arrested, etc.
 We used a small set of objects: three civilians, one detective, three locations
, and two items.
 We did not include 
\family typewriter
earthquake
\family default
, since this was meant to be an unbelievable action, and we did not include
 vehicles.
 Though we implemented the 
\family typewriter
shareClues
\family default
 action, there is only one inspector, so this action will never occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original problem was created for a traditional planner, so it did not
 include character goals.
 We gave each of the citizens different utility functions: Alice starts
 angry and wants to be calm.
 Bob is calm and wants everyone to be calm.
 Charlie starts angry and wants Alice to be dead.
 The author gains 1 point of utility if fewer than two citizens are angry
 and 1 point if someone has been arrested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original problem also did not model belief, but the 
\family typewriter
knows-clue
\family default
 predicate and 
\family typewriter
findClues
\family default
 action have obvious belief semantics.
 The investigator gains 1 point of utility for every location they investigate
 and every criminal they arrest.

 which was designed to allow conflict.
 The story cannot be told unless characters form plans that are thwarted
 before they are complete.
 For example, Hank's plan to steal the antivenom is thwarted by the sheriff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glaive supports intention but not belief.
 We used a default model of belief where characters observe the actions
 that happen at their location, with one exception.
 The sheriff needs to observe all instances of the 
\family typewriter
take
\family default
 action or else he will only be aware of crimes committed at his location.
 We also fixed a bug in the initial state of this problem where no sheriff
 had been specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original problem, the 
\family typewriter
travel
\family default
 action specified where the traveler was leaving from and where they were
 going to.
 The 
\family typewriter
force-travel
\family default
 action moved both the traveler and a helpless prisoner.
 Since moving alone and moving with a prisoner both required one action,
 and since the travel actions specified their origin, it was possible for
 characters to take meandering routes to their destinations.
 For example, once bitten by a snake, Timmy could tie up his father, move
 both of them to the jailhouse, and them travel by himself to the general
 store to steal the antivenom.
 This path is minimal in the sense that no actions can be left out, but
 it is strange.
 We have modified the 
\family typewriter
travel
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
force-travel
\family default
 actions so they no longer include their origin.
 We have also changed the 
\family typewriter
force-travel
\family default
 action to move only the prisoner.
 This avoids unnecessarily long paths that are a convenient but strange
 way to achieve the author's goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Glaive allows characters to adopt and drop goals.
 We translated these concepts into utility functions by using relationships.
 Every character has a numeric relationship, including a relationship with
 themselves.
 When someone a character loves is healthy, the relationship has a value
 of 2.
 When someone the character loves is sick, the relationship has a value
 of 1.
 Otherwise, relationships have a value of 0.
 All characters love themselves.
 Thus, when a character is bitten by a snake, their utility goes down, as
 does the utility of everyone who loves them.
 That utility can be restored by healing the sick loved one, or permanently
 lost if the loved one dies.
 The author's utility is 1 if Timmy is dead and Hank is tied up in the jailhouse
, otherwise the author utility is 0.

It tells the story of starship captain Zoe who wants to befriend the reptilian
 guardian of an alien planet which features a volcano that might erupt at
 any time.
 Zoe does not know that the guardian will get angry if she walks on the
 planet's surface, and conflict may ensue.

.
 Glaive supports intention but not belief.
 We used a default model of belief where characters observe the actions
 that happen at their location, with one exception.
 When someone sets foot on a location for which someone is the guardian,
 the guardian observes the action and gets angry.
 Otherwise, the exemplar stories that involve conflict between Zoe and the
 lizard beast are not possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We fixed a bug in this problem that prevented characters from traveling
 between locations on the planet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dead character always has a utility of 0.
 Otherwise, characters get 1 point of utility for being healthy and 1 point
 for being in a safe location.
 They also gain 1 point for each friend they have and lose 1 point for each
 enemy.
 Zoe can make an enemy of the lizard beast by visiting the planet, but the
 two can become friends via the 
\family typewriter
make_peace
\family default
 action.
 The author goal in the original problem could be achieved without taking
 any character actions, so we have made the author's utility a little more
 complex to encourage a variety of stories.
 The author gets 1 point for making the surface of the planet uninhabitable,
 1 point for each dead character, and 3 points if Zoe is friends with the
 lizard beast.
 Note it is not possible to achieve author utility 6 because Zoe's friendship
 toward the lizard beast ends if Zoe dies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original solution to this problem used by Ware et al.
 in their study is not a solution in our translated problem because Sabre
 requires that solutions be minimal (that is, no actions can be left out
 without decreasing author utility).
 The original story involved an interesting but unnecessary fight between
 Zoe and the lizard beast.
 That plan is still a valid sequence of explained actions in our problem,
 but because the fight can be left out, Sabre does not consider it a solution.

It describes the plot of the 1981 film by the same name.
 Indiana Jones is the only one who knows where to find the Ark of the Covenant.
 He travels to Tanis to excavate it, but before he can return home he is
 intercepted by the Nazis.
 They believe the Ark will grant them power and open it, but instead its
 angelic guardians kill the Nazis, leaving Jones free to retake it and return
 home.

 which supports intention but not belief.
 The original problem used a 
\family typewriter
knows-location
\family default
 predicate to ensure only Jones could dig up the Ark.
 We have replaced that with Sabre's model of belief.
 Because the Nazis could not have wrong beliefs about the outcome of opening
 the Ark, their goal in the original problem is that the Ark be open.
 In our version, their goal is to be immortal, and they have a wrong belief
 about the danger of opening the Ark, which is more in line with the film
 the problem is based on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author's utility is a straightforward translation of the original film's
 ending and the original problem's goal: 1 point if both the US Army has
 the Ark and the Nazis are dead, otherwise 0.
 Jones and the US Army have the same goal, that the US Army should have
 the Ark.
 The problem cannot be solved without reasoning about conflict—the ability
 of characters to form and begin executing plans and then be thwarted by
 others.
 Jones is the only one who can excavate the ark.
 He does so hoping to bring it to the Army, but before he can finish his
 plan the Nazis steal it.

\noindent
The shortest solution deviates from the plot of the original film by having
 the Nazis travel to the US before opening the Ark.
 Their plan is unnecessarily long, but still valid.
 At first, it may seem to violate Sabre's minimality constraint, because
 they could omit the travel action and still complete their plan, but they
 cannot omit the travel action and still open the Ark 
\emph on
in the US
\emph default
.
 This situation highlights a problem with putting a location parameter in
 the signature of each action—
\family typewriter
open(Nazis, Ark, USA)
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
open(Nazis, Ark, Tanis)
\family default
 are different actions, though we tend to think of them as the same.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
It is a simplified version of Robert Louis Stevenson's story by the same
 name.
 Jim Hawkins inherits a treasure map detailing the location of buried pirate
 treasure, but he has no ship to reach the island.
 Long John Silver has a ship but does not know the location of the treasure.
 First, Hawkins spreads a rumor that the treasure is buried on Treasure
 Island.
 Silver sails them both to the island.
 Hawkins digs up the treasure.
 Both characters hope to end up with the treasure, but Hawkins succeeds
 in the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem was designed before Sabre was implemented, and once tested we
 found it had two bugs which demonstrate the complexity of belief reasoning
 and which we have fixed.
 In the original, Silver begins the story believing the treasure's location
 is unknown: 
\family typewriter
believes(Silver, location(Treasure))=?
\family default
.
 This uses Sabre's unknown constant 
\family typewriter
?
\family default
, which behaves more like 
\emph on
null
\emph default
 than true uncertainty, so it might be more accurate to say that Silver
 believes the treasure is nowhere.
 Missing from the original problem, but added in our translation, is the
 additional fact that Hawkins believes Silver believes the treasure is nowhere.
 If this is not specified, then Sabre will assume Hawkins believes that
 Silver believes the same as he—that is, Hawkins will believe Silver knows
 the location of the treasure.
 If Silver already knows the location of the treasure, there is no need
 for the 
\family typewriter
rumor
\family default
 action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second bug in the original was that Hawkins was the only character who
 observed 
\family typewriter
rumor
\family default
.
 At first this does not seem like a bug, because the effects of 
\family typewriter
rumor
\family default
 directly modify Silver's beliefs so that he thinks the treasure is buried
 on the island.
 However, if Silver does not also observe the action, Silver will not believe
 that Hawkins believes the treasure is on the island.
 Silver can only expect Hawkins to sail with him to the island if Silver
 believes Hawkins believes there is treasure to be had there.
 In our translation, Silver also observes 
\family typewriter
rumor
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Utility functions are simple.
 Characters get 1 point for having the treasure and otherwise have a utility
 of 0.
 The author gets 1 point for Hawkins having the treasure, otherwise 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem is small and simple, perhaps trivially so.
 We added it to this collection because it demonstrates many of Sabre's
 features, including intention, conflict, belief, and belief updates.
 It can be a valuable debugging tool.
 It is also interesting because it requires an epistemic limit of 3 or higher
 to solve.

\noindent
This version of the problem, originally written for Sabre, is meant to be
 as small as possible while still offering a wide variety of possible stories.
 The player takes the role of Tom, who is given a coin by his sick grandmother.
 Tom can walk to the market to buy some medicine.
 Tom wins if he can return home with the medicine.
 He loses if he dies along the way.
 The problem also includes a bandit who wants to steal items and a town
 guard who wants to punish criminals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to win and lose.
 Tom can be killed by the bandit during a robbery.
 He can buy the medicine and return home.
 He can use his coin to buy a sword and resort to robbery to get the medicine,
 though he then risks being killed by the guard.
 Tom can also steal the coin from the bandit's camp to buy both a sword
 and the medicine.
 Tom can report the bandit's location to the guard, either to get the guard's
 help or to get the guard to leave his post so Tom can rob the merchant
 with no witnesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tom gets 1 point of utility for being home with the potion; otherwise his
 utility is 0.
 The merchant gets 2 points for every coin she has, as long as she is not
 a criminal.
 The merchant also gets 1 point for being at the market, her preferred location.
 The guard gets 2 points of utility when the bandit is dead, as long as
 the guard is not a criminal.
 The guard also gets 2 points of utility if Tom is a criminal, Tom is dead,
 and the guard is not a criminal.
 The guard gets 1 point for being at the market, his preferred location.
 The bandit gets 2 points for each coin she has (her coin can remain in
 the chest at her camp).
 The bandit also gets 2 points for having the medicine.
 The bandit gets 1 point for being at the camp, her preferred location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author gets 1 point when Tom is dead but 2 points if Tom is home with
 the medicine.
 Thus, the author will accept any story that ends, but prefers for Tom to
 win.

This problem has many other plans made of explained actions which Sabre
 does not consider solutions because they are not minimal (that is, some
 actions could be removed without lowering the author utility).
 These plans are still interesting because this problem was designed to
 be interactive, with a player controlling Tom and the planner constantly
 rewriting the story in response.
 Here is one example of an interesting but non-minimal plan where Tom reports

\noindent
The authors later implemented the story in Sabre.
 It is about two prison inmates, Ernest and Roy.
 They steal a pack of cigarettes and become the target of the prison bully
 who threatens to kill them.
 Ernest plans escape by stealing some civilian clothes to flee down the
 highway.
 Roy plans revenge on the bully by stealing a knife to stab him in the gym.
 In the original experiment, both make preparations for their plans and
 meet at the air vents.
 The vents lead both to the highway (for escape) and the gym (for revenge).
 The guards come running, and one inmate must give himself up so the other
 can succeed.
 The experiment altered the characters, timing, and locations of events
 to measure which events players remembered and which ending they chose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both Ernest and Roy gain 2 points of utility for stealing the cigarettes.
 They each take a -1 penalty if they have been threatened by the bully.
 They can avoid that penalty by escaping or killing the bully.
 They also gain a -3 penalty for being dead.
 The bully gains 1 point for being in the gym, his preferred location.
 He takes a -1 penalty if someone he has threatened is alive.
 He can remove that penalty by killing the people he has threatened.
 The author gains 1 point for each dead inmate.
 The author also gains 3 points when the cigarettes have been stolen and
 the threat to each inmate has been neutralized.

\noindent
There were many versions of the story used in Farrell et al.'s experiments
 that varied in the order and content, but all of them were a mix of the
 escape and revenge plans with only one inmate succeeding at the end.
 The actions in these plans are explained but not minimal (that is, actions
 can be removed without decreasing the author's utility), so Sabre does
 not consider them solutions.

\noindent
The problem is a grid world filled with agents and items.
 Each character wants one of the items.
 A character is happy if they have the item they want.
 Each character also loves one other character.
 A character gets 1 point of utility for being happy and 1 point if the
 character they love is happy.
 The author picks two characters.
 If both are happy, the author gets 1 point; otherwise the author utility
 is 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial locations of agents and items can be randomized.
 Whom characters love and which two the author wants to be happy can be
 randomized.
 Characters can also have random wrong beliefs about where items are or
 who wants which items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters can move around, pick up items, trade items with others, and
 tell other characters they want an item.
 Characters can lie about what item they want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem was designed to feature intention, belief, conflict, communication,
 and deception but in practice communication is rarely part of an optimal
 solution because characters can usually correct their wrong beliefs while
 moving around.
 Many randomized versions of this problem were used in the original experiments.
 For our version, we engineered the problem so the shortest solution requires
 deception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the solution, character C1 lies to C2, claiming to want I3 which C2 is
 holding.
 C2 will give I3 to C1 because C2 loves C1.
 That love is unrequited, because C1 trades it to its lover, C3 so both
 will have the items they want.

Though the solution can be found with an epistemic limit of 1, we recommend
 setting the epistemic limit to 2 for this problem because many interesting
