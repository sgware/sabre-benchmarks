/**
 * Space
 *
 * This domain tells the story of an interstellar explorer, Captain Zoe, who is
 * on a mission to befriend the reptilian guardian of an alien planet. The
 * domain was originally written by Stephen G. Ware in 2012 for an experiment
 * to validate a plan-based model of narrative conflict. It was used in the
 * CPOCL and Glaive narrative planners. It was adapted for Sabre by the same
 * author in 2023. A few changes have been made to allow additional stories:
 * (1) It is now possible to walk between places. There was a bug in the
 *     original domain where it was only possible to walk between landforms,
 *     and since there was only one landform the 'walk' action was never
 *     possible. It is now possible to walk between the Surface and Cave.
 * (2) It is now only possible to teleport between a ship and a landform. In
 *     the original domain, it was possible to teleport between the ship and
 *     any location. This allowed Zoe to teleport directly to the cave, which
 *     generally prevents the surface from being used in any shortest story.
 * (3) Place parameters have been added to the combat actions 'stun' and 'kill'
 *     so that other characters at those locations will observe the actions.
 * (4) The 'make_peace' action now requires the consent of both parties.
 * (5) The original author goal was only that the surface be uninhabitable.
 *     This means no character actions are required to reach a solution. The
 *     original author goal is still present, but there are now others that
 *     reward stories containing character actions:
 *     - The author scores 1 point for the surface being uninhabitable.
 *     - The author scores 1 point if Zoe is dead.
 *     - The author scores 1 point if the Lizard is dead.
 *     - The author scores 3 points if Zoe and the Lizard are friends.
 * (6) The original domain had several examples of actions causing characters
 *     to adopt goals (e.g. when a character is stunned, they want not to be
 *     stunned). This domain attempts to translate those goals into utility
 *     functions like so:
 *     - If a character is dead, their utility is 0.
 *     - If a character is healthy (i.e. not stunned) +1 to utility.
 *     - If a character is at a safe location, +1 to utility.
 *     - If a character c1 is friends with c2 (i.e. relationship(c1, c2) == 1)
 *       then c1 gets +1 per friend. Characters become friends via the
 *       make_peace action.
 *     - If a character c1 has an enemy c2 (i.e. relationship(c1, c2) == -1)
 *       then c1 gets -1 per enemy. A character becomes the enemy of a
 *       guardian when they are at the location guarded by that guardian.
 *     - Friend and enemy relationships end if either character dies.
 * (7) The story used in the original experiment by Ware et al. is a valid
 *     sequence of actions in this version, but it is not considered a solution
 *     because of Sabre's minimality constraint. The interactions between Zoe
 *     and the Lizard can be removed (making the plan shorter) without
 *     decreasing the author's utility.
 *
 * Shortest solution for author utility 1 (author temporal limit 2; character
 * temporal limit 0; epistemic limit 0):
 *   begin_erupt(Surface)
 *   erupt(Surface)
 *
 * Shortest solution for author utility 2 (author temporal limit 3; character
 * temporal limit 3; epistemic limit 1):
 *   teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)
 *   begin_erupt(Surface)
 *   erupt(Surface)
 *
 * Shortest solution for author utility 3 (author temporal limit 3; character
 * temporal limit 3; epistemic limit 1):
 *   teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)
 *   walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)
 *   make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)
 *
 * Shortest solution for author utility 4 (author temporal limit 5; character
 * temporal limit 3; epistemic limit 1):
 *   teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)
 *   walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)
 *   make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)
 *   begin_erupt(Surface)
 *   erupt(Surface)
 *
 * Shortest solution for author utility 5 (author temporal limit 6; character
 * temporal limit 3; epistemic limit 1):
 *   teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)
 *   walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)
 *   make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)
 *   begin_erupt(Surface)
 *   teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)
 *   erupt(Surface)
 *
 * The solution used in the study by Ware et al. which is not a solution in
 * Sabre because it is not minimal (author utility 1; author temporal limit 9;
 * character temporal limt 3; epistemic limit 1):
 *   teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)
 *   walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)
 *   attack(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)
 *   stun(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)
 *   begin_erupt(Surface)
 *   teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)
 *   break_free(Lizard, Surface)
 *   walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)
 *   erupt(Surface)
